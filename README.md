# darkturo's profile

This was my screen saver back in 1999 when I installed my first GNU/Linux distro. Seeing it always inspired me during those sleepless nights when I worked on my assignments, studied, learned Linux, and worked on my coding projects...

The other day, however, I learned that the design behind this iconic image was taken from a Japanese sushi book! How crazy is that? hahaha

If I had known back then, maybe I would be a sushi chef nowadays. 

Never say never... 

Fancy [an e-coffee with me](https://calendar.app.google/486u6B9JbXYiBksu5)? ... Let's talk :-)
